My initial thought process was creating a constructor class for a bingo card in order to easily manipulate and call commands for the bingo card.
Additionally this format would make it easier to implement a multiplayer version of the bingo game.

fillCard was a simple method with three steps
-vetting a random number to make sure it had not been called yet
-placing it into the array
-increasing the range of the random number as the rows increased

just as the steps, i separated my code into 3 parts do do each of the tasks




printCard was an easy loop to call each of the numbers, with a check to see if any of those numbers had already been "picked" by playGame

playGame replaced numbers that were on the bingocard with a 0 which printCard then printed as an X



checkWin
also did multiple loops to check each possible win condition and then returned an integer if any of the results were true
this ended up also being helpful to determine which win condition the player achieved
